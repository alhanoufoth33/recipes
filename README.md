## The Technologies used

## The approach taken
First, I did simple html page and I did simple design CSS for main page then I wrote code with React and java script and I used the google Book API to get the data and also use Open Library API,
then I worked CSS files to complete the interface for these pages, after that I did the steps to deploy my app then i pushed
the project to GitHub.
